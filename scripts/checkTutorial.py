"""checkTutorial.py -- check the tutorial scripts before their audio is made.

    checkTutorial                 every help\\Tutorial_*.inix in the project
    checkTutorial Tutorial_01     one of them, by stem or file name

WHAT IT CHECKS, script by script, step by step, and reports with the step
number so the line is easy to find:

  - the file parses: every line inside a [section] is Key=Value;
  - every [step] has a Say, and a step with a Key has either a Hear line or a
    Say or Note that names the silence ("nothing", "silent", "silence");
  - no Hear line writes an access key as "Alt+T": the reader says the words,
    "Alt plus T";
  - no script names a screen reader: they are written for everyone's reader;
  - a Hear line about a check box keeps the reader's order: label, "check
    box", state, then the key;
  - a Hear line does not carry a file name the way it is written --
    Introduction_to_Windows.mp3 -- but the way it is said: Introduction to
    Windows dot m p 3;
  - the first script (00) teaches the repeat key, Insert plus Up Arrow;
  - a Key line uses Homer key names: "Control", not "Ctrl", and modifiers
    in alphabetical order.

Zero problems is the answer the build wants; buildTutorials runs this first
and speaks nothing while there are problems. The log is
logs\\<App>-tutorials-check-yyyyMMdd-HHmmss.log in the project.
