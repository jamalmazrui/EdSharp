by Jamal Mazrui  
January 26, 2016  

These policy suggestions for Secretary Clinton are in the area of technology and disability.  They seek to be visionary, practical, and cross-disability.  They may be divided into three categories based on the type of action involved:  (1) regulation, (2) legislation, and (3) advocacy.

## Regulation
Significant progress is possible now simply by finalizing advanced drafts of regulations to implement existing statutes.  As explained in the articles ["Federal Disability Regulations Face Historic Delays"](http://www.beyondchron.org/inexcusable-delay-in-federal-disability-regulations/) and ["Justice Delayed in Federal Disability Regs"](http://www.beyondchron.org/even-more-delay-in-federal-disability-regulations/), regulations are overdue for the following laws:

* Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act, mandating that federal agencies use accessible information and communication technology (ICT), regulated by the U.S. Access Board

* Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), requiring accessibility of websites hosted by state and local governments, regulated by the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ).

* Title III of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), requiring accessibility of commercial websites, regulated by DOJ.

* Also Title III of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), requiring text captions and audio description in movie theaters, regulated by DOJ.

* Guidelines for the accessibility of health information technology (HIT) under the Affordable Care Act (ACA) and other health care laws, regulated by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) and the U.S. Access Board.

* ["The Marrakesh Treaty to Facilitate Access to Published Works for Persons Who Are Blind, Visually Impaired, or Otherwise Print disabled"](https://nfb.org/marrakeshfactsheet), which the Administration has to initiate as an executive action by submitting the treaty to the U.S. Senate for ratification, internationally proposed by the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO).

* Reimbursement rates for telecommunications relay service (TRS) providers, paid through a universal service fund operated by the Federal Communications  Commission (FCC), which the National Association of the Deaf (NAD) [urges to be raised](https://nad.org/about-us/priorities) in order to sustain a viable market for TRS providers.

## Legislation
The following legislative proposals have been made to Congress by disability consumer organizations:

* [Accessible Instructional Materials in Higher Education Act](https://nfb.org/aimheafactsheet) (AIM HE), which would authorize the creation of voluntary accessibility guidelines for electronic instructional materials and information technology used in higher education and will incentivized the use of these guidelines, proposed by the National Federation of the Blind (NFB).

* Expansion of Medicaid and Medicare to cover aural, speech, and low vision rehabilitation; hearing and low vision aids; augmentative communication devices; and other assistive technology for communications access -- proposed variously by the American Foundation for the Blind (AFB), American Speech, Language, and Hearing Association (ASLA), [Hearing Loss Association of America](http://www.hearingloss.org/content/hlaa-supports-medicare-coverage-on-hearing-aids) (HLAA), and the Autistic Self Advocacy Network (OSAN).

## Advocacy
In a speech or interview by Secretary Clinton, an expression of support for an issue can help its advancement through news coverage and follow up stories.  Such statements could include the following:

* Signing the ["Declaration of The Rights of People with Cognitive Disabilities to Technology and Information Access"](http://www.colemaninstitute.org/declaration), published by the Coleman Institute for Cognitive Disabilities at the University of Colorado.

* Requesting that the National Endowment for the Arts require, as appropriate, audio description in its grants, and for it to consider creating a national registry of described content, proposed by the American Council of the Blind (ACB).

* Supporting parity in health care between mental and physical causes of ailment.
